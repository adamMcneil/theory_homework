CS5200 Homework 5 Theory \\
Adam McNeil \\
Question 1 \\
% C = 300c + 36a + 90c \\
% X = 60c + 12a + 10c \\
% Y = 60c + 6a + 30c \\
Calories: 300 = 60X + 60Y \\
Vitamin A: 36 = 12X + 6Y \\ 
Vitamin C: 90 = 6X + 30Y \\
Cost = 1.2X + 1.5Y
Solution:\\
X = 2.5 cups\\
Y = 2.5 cups\\

Question 3\\
Since we are given the nodes one at a time we can sort the nodes as we get them. 
It would only take n time to insert a node into a sorted list.
Since it only takes n manipulations after that, for each new node we could find the convex hull in ${n^2}$ steps.

Question 4\\
Yes A is in P.\\
Yes A is in NP.\\
He should not get the million dollar reward because all he showed was that P is a subset of NP problems.
In order to get the prize he would need to show that a np complete problem could be reduced to a problem in P.\\
